This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections.  The `bug.js` file showcases an Express app with an asynchronous operation that may fail.  However, it lacks proper error handling, resulting in the error being silently swallowed. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle such errors, providing a robust and informative solution.
